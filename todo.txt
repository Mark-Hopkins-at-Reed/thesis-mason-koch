Ask Mark for more math stuff. (Suggested by David)  //"I don't know what he wants..." See if Sutton and Barto hade anything David would like to explore
See if Reed has any computer clusters I could use for my thesis. (Suggested by David)  //"not really". 
Split the weights into a new neural network for every pair of Pokemon.
In December, when you will have much time and not much communication with advisors, clean up this list of accumulated crud:
  Fix abominable performance.
  Finalise how many status conditions you are going to have and update game_model accordingly. For instance, confusion is not mutually exclusive with the other status conditions. And you might want to know how many turns the Pokemon has been asleep.
  Make \footnote{\cite{blablabla}} in your thesis prettier.
  Deal with copyright issues at https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-cient.
  I'm getting a wait request at the beginning of a battle at least for our AI. (Not often, but sometimes). Shouldn't it be a wait request for both, which should cause a crash?
  After training last time, the pvec values were about -700 for the legal actions and close to 0 for the illegal ones. Investigate why this might be the case and how you might make them less unbalanced, provided it is still a problem in 6v6.
  Everything except health is a one-hot encoding, while the health can take values in the hundreds. But the weights are the same size. Perhaps make the default weights for variables other than health bigger?
Contemplate why we have one model that outputs a vector instead of multiple models which output scalars.
Settle on 0 indexing or 1 indexing in thesis.
Learn more about the Pokemon game mechanics (e.g. volatiles) and add those to the state.
