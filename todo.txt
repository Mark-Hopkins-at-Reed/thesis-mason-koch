Clean up the the recently added code.
Organise the recently added code into reasonably sane commits and pull request.

Make sure model in bookkeeper is getting passed by reference.
Make preprocess_observation more comprehensive. (e.g. statuses).
Flesh out minimax writeup.
In choose_action: remember which Pokemon are fainted, don't recompute every time.
Make it run several battles before updating weights.
Is it necessary to import numpy as np in both pkmn.py, preprocess_observation.py and bookkeeper.py?
Investigate the x variables getting transposed after being put into the bookkeeper and then vstacked. For instance, in test_bookkeeper.
Make it so that preprocess_observation returns the entire state, not just updates?
Actually use the action space instead of appreciating that it is there.

	For David:
Add section on modeling the game. State, utilty, etc. Action is ultimately a function which transforms state to another state. Reward function. 
Put why minimax does not work in the introduction.
Model in the introduction.
More clarity. e.g. fpoly(x) = [x\\x^2\\x^2\\x^2\\x^2].
Write for a general audience.
