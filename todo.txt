In choose_action: remember which Pokemon are fainted, don't recompute every time.
Make preprocess_observation store which Pokemon is on the field in a one-hot encoding, or else create different weights for each Pokemon.
Make preprocess_observation more comprehensive.
Make it run several battles before updating weights.
Is it necessary to import numpy as np in both pkmn.py, preprocess_observation.py and bookkeeper.py?
Investigate the x variables getting transposed after being put into the bookkeeper and then vstacked. For instance, in test_bookkeeper.
Make sure model in bookkeeper is getting passed by reference.
Make it so that preprocess_observation returns the entire state, not just updates.
Actually use the action space instead of appreciating that it is there.

	For David:
Add section on modeling the game. State, utilty, etc. Action is ultimately a function which transforms state to another state. Reward function. 
Put why minimax does not work in the introduction.
Model in the introduction.
More clarity. e.g. fpoly(x) = [x\\x^2\\x^2\\x^2\\x^2].
Write for a general audience.
